# Santander

Under their current system, a small number of Santander’s customers receive many
recommendations while many others rarely see any resulting in an uneven customer
experience. In their second competition, Santander is challenging Kagglers to
predict which products their existing customers will use in the next month based
on their past behavior and that of similar customers.

With a more effective recommendation system in place, Santander can better meet
the individual needs of all customers and ensure their satisfaction no matter
where they are in life.

Based on Users history and previous products they subscribed to,
predict what products he will be interested in future.


# Data

In this competition, you are provided with 1.5 years of customers behavior data
from Santander bank to predict what new products customers will purchase.
The data starts at 2015-01-28 and has monthly records of products a customer has,
such as "credit card", "savings account", etc. You will predict what additional
products a customer will get in the last month, 2016-06-28, in addition to what
they already have at 2016-05-28. These products are the columns named: ind_(xyz)_ult1,
which are the columns #25 - #48 in the training data. You will predict what a
customer will buy in addition to what they already had at 2016-05-28. 

The test and train sets are split by time, and public and private leaderboard
sets are split randomly.

# My approach
Best Private score: 0.030378(Rank 120/1785) {Notebook 11. and 12.}

Divided data month wise for so that it will be easier for my local computer to handle.
So a simple month based grep will create files `train_2015_01_28.csv` that contain data
from Jan 2015 and so on.

And for each month, computed what users added in then next month, say for example for
the month June 2015, there are total 631957 train data rows, but the number of products
added in that month were 41746 by all the users combined. This data will be in files
`added_product_2015_06_28.csv`. I precomputed all these so that I don't have to do it again
and again for each model. For each month we will be training on the users that added a
new product the next month. That makes the data even more maneagable in terms of size.
Foreach month there are on an average of 35-40k users who added a new product.
We are interested how likely a user is interested in a new product.
Thanks to `BreakfastPirate` for making the train data an order of magnitude lesser by 
showing in the forums this approach gives us meaningful results. The computation of
`added_product_*` files can be found in `999. Less is more.ipynb` notebook.

## Feature Engineering.
So just to reiterate, the final training will be done on, for each month, we get all the users
who added a product in the next month, which reduces the train size by 10x, and combine this data
for all the months.

And data clean up and imputation is done by assuming for categorical variables the median values,
and for varibles like rent, mean based on the city of the user. This job was made a lot easier
because of `Alan (AJ) Pryor, Jr.`'s script that cleans up the data and does imputation.


Lag features from the last 4 months. Along with the raw lags of the product subscription
history of a user, I computed 6 more features based on the past 4 month history of
product subscription that goes as below.

* product exists atleast once in the past
* product exists all the months(last 4 months)
* product doesn't exist at all
* product removed in the past(removed before this current month)
* product added in the past(added before this current month)
* product removed recently(removed this current month)
* product added recently(added this current month)

These are the features that gave me the best results. Trained using xgboost.
and you can find them in notebook `11. ` and best hyperparameters through
grid search in notebook `12. `

__Best Hyperparameters through grid search__:  
`num_class`: 24,  
`silent`: 0,   
`eval_metric`: 'mlogloss',   
`colsample_bylevel`: 0.95,   
`max_delta_step`: 7,  
`min_child_weight`: 1,  
`subsample`: 0.9,  
`eta`: 0.05,  
`objective`: 'multi:softprob',  
`colsample_bytree`: 0.9,  
`seed`: 1428,  
`max_depth`: 6

## Results:

Notebooks convention is that the number of notebook will correspond to the notebook
that start with that file, and the decimal number will also be an extra submission in
the same notebook. So, you can find all 18, 18.4, 18.2 in the notebook that starts
with 18. in my notebooks. And all the notebooks contain the results, graphs and etc.

And notebooks that start with 999. are helper scripts and etc.

## Additional appraoches that I tried.
I looked at product histories of several users over months, to understand when,
a product is more likely to be added, to help me with my intuitions, and add more features.
Below are product histories of few users.

Below is a representation of how similar each product is to other products if
each product is defined as a set of users who subscribed to that particular product.

__Cosine Similarities of products__
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/hBDBkn6.png)

__Jacobian Similarities of products__
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/LVXPVhL.png)

There are two important things from the above graphs, that I wanted to capture in terms
of features.

* From the product history vizs, if a particular product is being added and removed
consitently and if it doesn't exist it is more likely to be added.. So features like,
is_recently_added, is_recently_removed, exists_in_the_past, no_of_times_product_flanked
no_positive_flanks, no_negative_flanks and etc.. In my training set, I only considered
the past 4 months product subscription history, but from one of the top solution
sharing posts I noticed that people used entire product history to generate these features.
That might have increased my score just considering the entire history for each month
to generate these features.
* Another thing I wanted to capture is how likely is a product to be subscribed based
on other products that were recently added. Say from the similarity vizs you can see that
how closely `cno_fin` is correlated to `nomina` or `nom_pens` and from some product history
vizs I observed that if `cno_fin` was added recently even though `nomina` never had a history
for a given user, he is likely to add it next month. So additional features I generated
are based on current months subscription data, from jacobian similarity weights and cosine
similarity weights I simply summed the weights of unsubscribed products of the respective
subscirbed products. These ended up being valuable features, with hight feature importance
scores but I didn't find them add more to my lb score.
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/cQGfa0p.png)
* Additional features I tried are lag features related to user attributes, but I didn't find these
added much to my lb scores. Say a user changed from non primary subscriber to a primary
subscriber, and he might be intersted in or be eligible for more products..
* I wanted to caputure the trends and seasonality of product subscriptions, so along with raw month
features, as jan is closer to december then what 1, 12 represents so instead use `np.cos`, `np.sin`
of the month numbers. We can also use a period of 3 months by just using features
`np.cos(month/4)` and `np.sin(month/4)`

## Things learned from post competition solution sharing.
* Entire product history is much more use ful than limiting myself to just 4 past months
* Likilyhood of a product getting subscribed is also dependent on the month. I was not able to
successfully exploit this.

Still reading various solutions, will update them once I get done with them.. Here are the direct links
